If you're anything like me, then to learn and understand a topic or idea, you must be able to explain things in the most simplest of ways.

Before starting this Sinatra project, I was only able to somewhat grasp the details of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and MVC (Model-View-Controller), but if someone were to ask me to explain it, I'd be at a loss for words. After creating a Sinatra app from scratch, however, I was able to dive into the process of what is needed to fully execute my idea.

**My Idea:**

I wanted to create a portal where a healthcare professional (i.e. a doctor, nurse, med. tech) could sign up for the portal by creating a unique username and password, which would then allow them to create patients in the system and adding information such as the patient's name, birthdate, gender, and any notes pertaining to the patient and their visit with the healthcare professional. Each user could then only view and edit the patient(s) she/he created. 

Learning Sinatra wasn't completely easy. It's as if I was blindly going through each lesson and lab.
